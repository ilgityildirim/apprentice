### Why I built this

I was tired. Tired of;

* My machine sounding like it was about to take off every time I opened a modern IDE & tools with a few projects.
* Context-switching between my editor, my terminal, and multiple tools.
* Juggling multiple tools that never quite fit together.
* Subscriptions that kept adding up.
* Tools that try to lock me into their ecosystem instead of letting me choose.
* Feeling like I would lose my edge as an engineer because tools were doing too much for me instead of with me.
* Tools that couldn't keep up with the technological changes happening around them.

### What I believe
I strongly believe;
* If you pay for a tool, you should own that specific version forever. You paid for it, it should be yours to keep.
* Development tools should be lightweight and fast.
* You should be able to choose your own AI providers, not be locked into one.
* Tools should help you learn and improve, not hide the mechanics from you.
* Development environments should be organized around "work sessions" that keep context together; multiple sessions with agent(s), terminal etc.
* You should be able to run your tools anywhere, without complex installations.
* Development tools should get out of your way and let you focus on building things when you need to / want to.

**Apprentice is the answer.** It's portable, it's fast, and it gets out of your way when you just want to build or 
teaches you / helps you not forget / remember how things work when you want to learn.

### What makes it different?

* **Works with Your Subscriptions:** pick your AI provider that you've already subscribed to; whether you prefer **Claude Code, OpenAI, Gemini, GitHub Copilot**, or running **Local LLMs**, Apprentice handles them all.
* **Work Sessions:** A sane way to organize. Create a "Feature," then spin up Terminal or Agent sessions inside it. Keep the context where it belongs.
* **Portable:** No installers. No registry clutter. Just download the binary / executable and run it.
* **The "Use It or Lose It" Philosophy:** Designed to teach "vibecoders" (non-technical users) how things work while keeping seasoned engineers sharp. It doesn't hide the mechanics from you; it helps you remember and learn.

### Download & Installation
